{"question": "The Canadian tax code is on GitHub. Do they offer anything else that might be of use to AI? Data sets of answers to common questions?", "answer": "No. The Justice Canada GitHub repository provides a structured XML version of the Income Tax Act and regulations, and the CRA’s open‑data portal contains statistical datasets (for example, T1 filing compliance, TFSA, charity and GST/HST statistics). There is no public dataset of question‑and‑answer pairs for Canadian tax. CRA’s “common questions” web pages are published as HTML rather than machine‑readable datasets, and Canada.ca design guidance notes that FAQ pages are generally discouraged【106961751251752†L45-L57】【816630592315363†L334-L347】. To build a retrieval‑augmented model you would need to scrape CRA common‑questions pages, mine tax forums and generate synthetic questions/answers based on Income Tax Act sections.", "source_section": "Open Government data and structured data design guidance", "source_url": ["https://open.canada.ca/data/dataset/ff56de85-f8b9-4719-8dff-ecf362adf0af", "https://design.canada.ca/guidance/structured-data.html", "https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/news/newsroom/tax-tips/tax-tips-2025/find-answers-taxpayers-most-common-questions-right-here.html"], "tags": ["open-data", "datasets", "FAQ", "Canadian-tax"], "difficulty": "tricky"}

{"question": "I live in a home owned by my common‑law partner. Can I open a First Home Savings Account (FHSA)?", "answer": "No. CRA’s FHSA guidance explains that to be a qualifying individual you must not live in a home that you or your spouse or common‑law partner owns during the part of the calendar year before the account is opened. One example shows that Carlos lived in a home owned by his common‑law partner; because he was considered to be a homeowner, he could not open an FHSA as a first‑time home buyer【367498923392798†L468-L473】.", "source_section": "FHSA examples – Opening your FHSAs", "source_url": ["https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/first-home-savings-account/opening.html"], "tags": ["fhsa", "eligibility", "first-time-homebuyer"], "difficulty": "tricky"}

{"question": "I co‑owned a house from 2020 to 2024. When can I open a First Home Savings Account?", "answer": "You must wait at least four calendar years after you last owned a home. CRA’s example of Aysha explains that she co‑owned a house from 2020 to 2024; since she is not considered a first‑time home buyer until four years after disposing of her share, she cannot open an FHSA until 2028【367498923392798†L456-L465】.", "source_section": "FHSA examples – Opening your FHSAs", "source_url": ["https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/first-home-savings-account/opening.html"], "tags": ["fhsa", "eligibility", "first-time-homebuyer"], "difficulty": "tricky"}

{"question": "Are private school tuition fees for my child tax deductible in Canada?", "answer": "No. The federal tuition tax credit applies to tuition fees for post‑secondary courses or courses that provide occupational skills and meet specific criteria. CRA notes that fees paid for elementary or secondary school are generally not eligible, and you cannot claim tuition amounts reimbursed by an employer or paid for by a government training program【911597123159426†L53-L87】.", "source_section": "Eligible tuition fees", "source_url": ["https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-32300-education-amounts/eligible-tuition-fees.html"], "tags": ["education", "tuition", "credits"], "difficulty": "tricky"}

{"question": "Can I split my pension income with my spouse?", "answer": "Yes, but certain rules apply. CRA explains that a married or common‑law couple can make a joint election to split eligible pension income, with one spouse (the transferring spouse) allocating a portion of their pension to the other (the receiving spouse). Only one election can be made for each tax year, and both spouses must agree to the transfer【775986463049154†L53-L86】. The election does not change the total pension income; it only redistributes it between the spouses for tax purposes.", "source_section": "Pension income splitting", "source_url": ["https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/pension-income-splitting.html"], "tags": ["pension", "income-splitting", "spouses"], "difficulty": "tricky"}
